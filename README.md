This tutorial is a precursor to the set up of data pipelines and model generation.

You may still complete this tutorial if you are not familiar with the Python programming language.

Please find downloadable sample notebooks for the tutorials : . Note that these tutorials are for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in production environments. To execute them properly, youâ€™ll need to set up your own S3 bucket or provision services from BTP, including an AI Core with a standard plan for narrow AI and an extended plan for GenAI HUB. Ensure you input the service keys of these services into the relevant cells of the notebook.Link to notebook
